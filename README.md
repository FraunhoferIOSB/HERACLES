# The HERACLES Ontology

[![N|Solid](http://www.heracles-project.eu/sites/default/files/logo-heracles.png)](http://www.heracles-project.eu) 

 
The HERACLES Ontology helps integrating data for the preservation of cultural heritage in the context of climate change. It was developed during the EU project HERACLES. HERACLES main objective is to design, validate and promote responsive systems/solutions for effective resilience of CH against climate change effects, considering as a mandatory premise an holistic, multidisciplinary approach through the involvement of different expertise.

### Domains of the HERACLES Ontology

The HERACLES Ontology describes several topics, which are categorized into nine domains listed in the table below.

| Domains of the Heracles Ontology||
| ------ | ------ |
| (Tangible) Cultural Heritage Assets  |  Maintenance and Response Actions|
| Materials |Climate Change Effects |
| Damages | Sensors and Measurements |
| Risk Assessment | Standard Operating Procedures |
| Stakeholders and Roles |  |

### The HERACLES Ontology

Before introducing the main classes of the ontology, a brief paragraph will explain the following ontology schemata. 

The ontology pictures shall enhance the readers’ comprehensibility about the relationships. The class pictures do not contain every property to enable the reader to keep track of the matter. For simplification, datatype properties and inverse properties are omitted. Class hierarchies appear, where they seem reasonable. Dashed arrows indicate a relationship property. Continuous arrows depict a parent-to-child class relationship. Instances of classes are shown in light-blue, edged boxes. A colon separates the content of instances box; the first part gives the name of the instance, the latter part gives the class the instance belongs to.

 ### Entity and Entity Type
 In the ontology, we distinguish between the classes Entity and Entity Type. An Entity Type represents the various types an instance of the class Entity can be instantiated as. This modelling enables the class Entity to compound several types. A damage for example can be of both types 'discoloration' and 'flaking'. The actual manifestation of the damage is part of the class Entity.
